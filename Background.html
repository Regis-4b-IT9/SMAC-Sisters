We have discovered that SMAC is facing academic funding issues. Now, the aim of our proposal is to attempt and completely resolve this by disseminating posters, infographics, and movies that outline the history, needs, and ways we can assist SMAC.
<br><br>
after successfully collecting donations. The children's academic demands, including tuition (if required), requirements (printing of project materials, assignments, and others), pocket money (during recess or snack time, if needed), shoes, and uniform tailoring, will be collected and broken down with the help of financial gifts. Children who fit the item will also receive pre-owned donations (for example shoes, uniform, etc.). uniform cloth for tailoring will also be appreciated because it lowers costs.
<br><br>
The dissemination of posters, infographics, and movies will aid in the transmission of knowledge. These tools will assist SMAC in raising more money and donations to meet the educational needs of the kids.
<br><br>
When interactions exceed 100–500 shares, likes, and views, at least 5,000 pesos are donated, 5–10 people donate gently used products, and 2–5 people inquire about sponsorships, the project is deemed successful or effective.
<br><br>
Since AdDU JHS students are taught to be magis, to serve others as much as possible, and to aid without expecting anything in return, posting posters, infographics, and films should be simple for them to complete. By doing this, we can support these underprivileged kids and serve as role models for them, enabling them to serve as role models for other kids as well.
<br><br>
The project is important for the institution because it is beneficial to everyone. Specifically, the project will help the institution gain proper benefactors and sponsors, while us, the students will be able to practice good values, management, and cooperation skills. In summary, the project is effective to us the students, the economy, ateneo, and most importantly SMAC
<br><br>
The project is beneficial to everyone in general for a multitude of reasons. Firstly, it furthers the economy. Secondly, it promotes food values in the community. Thirdly, it helps the kids in the institution to achieve bigger things with their unseen potential from past financial problems. In conclusion, these reasons are what make me confidently say that this project is beneficial to the general public.
</div>

<div id= "content">
<p>Rationale</p>
We aim to help our partner institution (SMAC) in order to practice good values promoted in our school such as kindness, helpfulness, sincerity, and empathy. In addition to this, we wanted to experience a project in which we could improve not just ourselves but the people around us. Overall, this project helps everyone in their own ways.

<p>Background and Significance of the Study</p>
These days, the pandemic (COVID 19) which is now an endemic had affected multiple institutions. One of these being SMAC. This corporation aims to help children in need by giving them shelter, food, and proper education. Currently they are having trouble with educational funds; which is why we want to help them by executing this project. We plan to help them by creating infographics, posters, and promotional videos. So that we could help them gain sponsorships and donations.

<p>Details of the Project</p>
<p>Preparation</p>
1. Check supplies to be used for the project<br>
2. See if the budget plan is correct in order to make sure that we will not be behind in funds<br>
3. Contact the partner institution for updates on their end when the project proposal has been initiated<br>
4. Make sure that all of the parts of the project is working (such as if there is enough posters or if the advertisements have been made correctly)<br>
<p>During</p>
1. Gather the supplies to be used.<br>
2. Proofread the plan<br>
3. Create promotional videos, make posters and infographics.<br>
4. Teach them how to create the posters and infographics.<br>
5. Help them find sponsorships in the first week or first few days.<br>
6. Try to cooperate and communicate with them smoothly.<br>
<p>Implementation</p>
1. Revisit the partner institution and interview them again.<br>
2. Ask them about what’s changed<br>
3. Ask them if the problem has been solved (educational funding)<br>
4. Give a report of the entire project to our teachers.<br>
5. Interview their new benefactors and sponsors as to why they chose to donate (if possible)<br>

<p>Budget projection</p>
<p>Monetary</p>
The resources needed for our partner institution to gain sponsorships and donation are the things needed for infographics, posters which are printer, ink, papers.

<p>In kind</p>
Making infographics, posters and promotional video we can help them lessen their problems with educational funding, we can also help them gain sponsorships and donation.

<p>Human Resources</p>
The human resources needed are:<br><br>

Tutor volunteers (at least 30 people)<br><br>

Group 4b (Abellera, Amper, Del Fierro, Lungtad): designing the posters, analyzing and monitoring the flow of the proposal and the  effectiveness, posting of the posters, infographics, and videos, and printing of the posters<br><br>

<p> Research methodology and description</p>
We gathered crucial information/data, such as the age ranges of the individuals in the SMAC as well as their financial problems and current needs. Specifically, in the institution there are currently 2, 1-5 year olds, 18, 6-12 year olds, 6, 13-19 year olds, and 2, 20-50 year olds. From the interview with them, we also found out about their current problem with educational funds or just their funds in general which was because of the pandemic and not enough sponsors. They say that they plan to use the educational fund (if given) to create classrooms inside the institution with books, papers, pencils, and other materials. They say that if given the proper funding, it would greatly help the children to succeed in the future. In short, the data gathered via our efforts and the institutions, greatly sheds more light on their current situation and how we could help them as members of society and as ateneans.
<br><br>
We gathered this data by conducting an interview Aug 23, 2022 and data research from July 27, 2022 to October 25, 2022 to accurately get the latest and needed information. We contacted SMAC Sisters head Sister Luzviminda C. Pepito to gather the most recent information and needs as of the moment such as long-term issues the institution is dealing with, currently.  We have talked through phone calls, emails, and text to ask questions for the interview and data gathering. We have also done our research throughout the internet, looking for articles and videos in which the SMAC Sisters are included. 
<br><br>
We consider this data important in order to continue our research as it helps us in order to figure out the amount of funds and volunteers we may need in order to achieve these goals as well as be able to keep track of the items and resources we may need for the children such as medication, school supplies, clothes, daily necessities such as soap and food, and other necessities the children may need. This data can also help with letting us know how to ration items in case of an emergency, tell us how much resources we may need in order to apply certain projects into the institution and as well as let us be able to find the needed sponsorships we may need in order to do certain projects and certain tasks.
<br><br>
I found the educational fund/overall fund problem of the group interesting because I thought that with SMAC being featured by the AdDu to students, I expected them to have many sponsors, or at least enough sponsors to keep them from having any issues, financially. From my knowledge, the SMAC was interviewed by AdDu and it was introduced to us students, in our group. In addition to this the SMAC also has few individuals, especially the ones who need schooling. Overall, me and my group really found this issue interesting because of the why or question in our heads, which is why they have a shortage in educational funds.
<br><br>
I can ensure that the data i have gathered is reliable and valid as we have contacted the SMAC institution themselves and asked them the information and questions we need to be answered for our information gathering as well as we have personally asked them about their problems and how it affects their overall performance and progress in doing certain projects and their output in certain tasks in certain conditions such as if they had a small or large amount of funding or if they had problems with the attitudes of volunteers and if they have had problems raising the children themselves. Therefore we can assure the data we have gathered is reliable and valid as we have the Sisters in the SMAC institution themselves on these certain questions and how they are able to work around these problems and how we can be able to think of ideas that can be able to support them.

Effect of frequency difference in addition of Mango, and Banana peel compost as fertilizer on the height and number of leaves of  Raphanus Sativus
</div>

<div id= "content">

<p>Background and significance of the study</p>
This proposal will help produce healthy crops and possibly extra income. By using the scientific method this experiment can be proved and tested. We will be conducting an experiment analyzing how the frequency of fruit peel compost addition affects the height, and number of leaves of Raphanus sativus. Towards communities and the environment fruit peel composting is valuable because of its multiple benefits to the environment and to the community. From the data I gathered, these fruit peels have nutrients like potash, iron, zinc, calcium, citrate content etc. In addition to this, Fruit peels are also high in both macro and micro nutrients which promote plant growth. Humans could reduce the waste load and receive more advantages than inorganic fertilizer by using fruit peel as fertilizer. In brief,  fruit peel composting is a great way to benefit you, your community and the environment without having to spend money. 
<br><br>
SMAC can benefit from this as fruit peel compost can be used as a fertilizer by SMAC and plant vegetables. This can also help them lessen expenses and produce extra money by selling the fertilizer itself. Vegetables they have grown can be sold in local markets or online. In the process of making fruit peel composition it won't cost the institution anything at all as they can use their fruit peels to make the compost and it can be easily found and done. Research shows that garden activities such as composting can help give peace to one's mind, which can also help distract the children from personal problems and trauma from neglect and abandonment. From what we have gathered children in SMAC are in need of professional for their mental health there for gardening activities such as composting and planting can somewhat lessen and/or forget about their problems for a while

<p>Research problem</p>
How will the difference in frequency in addition of Banana, and Mango peel compost as fertilizer affect the length and number of leaves of Raphanus Sativus?

<p>Hypothesis</p>
If the frequency of compost is increased, Then the length and amount of leaves found in the Raphanus Sativus will increase.

<p>Review of related literature</p>
Compost is a mixture of organic matter such as banana peels, orange skins, etc. To soil, compost is an all organic fertilizer which is cheap, as well as effective. It even helps with balancing Ph level, enriching the soil, suppressing pests, and discouraging certain weeds. To the environment, compost helps by reducing greenhouse gasses and creating healthy soil. Finally, for plants, compost helps roots expand, water drain, and air enter clay or silt soil by loosening firmly linked particles. 
<br><br>
Compost also encourages healthy root systems to be cultivated with compost, which reduces runoff. Lastly, since compost includes helpful microorganisms that protect plants from diseases and pests, it can help to decrease the need of chemical pesticides. In short, compost is an environmentally friendly, cheap, organic fertilizer with benefits and is most of the time even better than artificial fertilizers.
<br><br>
The plant our group will focus on is Raphanus Sativus. Nutrients needed by radishes are Potassium which strengthens plants, contributes to early growth and helps retain water. It also affects the plant’s disease and insect suppression, Potassium is metabolized by plants through a process known as root interception, in which roots extend through the soil profile to make contact with nutrients. Phosphorus is responsible for assisting with the growth of roots and flowers. Phosphorus also helps plants withstand environmental stress and harsh winters. Through diffusion, which is the transfer of a nutrient ion from a location of high concentration to an area of lower concentration, phosphorus gets to the root surface.
<br><br>
Raphanus Sativus gives nutrients that are needed for our body to be healthy and the elements that were needed for its optimal growth are Potassium to be strengthened. Raphanus Sativus also has iron which can resist disease.
<br><br>
Fruit peels are a good source of nutrients for Raphanus Sativus. Radishes have plenty of phosphorus so if farmers intend to add fertilizer before sowing,they can use something like Banana, and Mango peels. These are some examples of fruit peels that include phosphorus and other nutrients needed to help Raphanus Sativus’ growth. 
<br><br>
Mango skins are rich in nutrients like Vitamin A, C, K, folate, magnesium, choline, potassium. Banana peels are 3.25 percent phosphorus, one of the other major nutrients that plants need to grow. Phosphorus helps rooting, improves winter hardiness and speeds up flowering and fruiting. 
<br><br>
Chop your fruit peels, scraps and trim pieces smaller before composting them, especially tough varieties such as citrus peels and melon rinds. They'll decompose quickly, with less risk of creating odors or attracting pests.  
<br><br>
(Soaking the banana peels allows the nutrients to leech into the water, and once it hits the soil, the roots grab all the minerals.) 
<br><br>
Bury your fruit peels at least 10 inches deep in the pile. Covering the fruit waste will also help reduce odor and pest problems.   Layer your fruit scraps with carbon-rich "brown" ingredients such as straw, hay, dry leaves or sawdust. 
<br><br>
These balance the nitrogen-rich fruit, helping keep the pile balanced and its beneficial bacteria active. 
<br><br>
The other benefits the compost may provide to the Raphanus Sativus and its environment would be the presence of other nutrients from the compost such as potassium, phosphorus, and iron. These nutrients provide lots of benefits such as helping the plant resist diseases, increase crop yield, heightens overall quality of the crop yield, helps with the movement of water, nutrients and carbohydrates in the plant, gives energy to the plant’s ATP, helps move oxygen through the plant, and etc. The other benefits the compost may bring forth is the support of growth for the Raphanus Sativus as normal soil would not be enough to give it all of its needs, therefore using compost may help support its growth by giving it more nutrients as well as acting as a foundation for the Raphanus Sativus to grow on. These are some of the many benefits the compost provides to the plant and how they help with Raphanus Sativus overall quality and growth. 
<br><br>
There are various ways to use compost. Sprinkle compost on top or mix it into your vegetable beds/pot, blend it with potting soil to revitalize indoor plants, or spread it on top of the soil on your lawn as a soil amendment. Add a half-inch layer of compost around the base of the plants. Give a vegetable garden plenty of compost during September to November.  
<br><br>
Provide:<br>
Controlled plant with no compost
Experimental plant 1 with ½ inch of compost around the base every week<br>
Experimental plant 2 with ½ inch of compost around the base every 2 weeks<br>
Experimental plant 3 with ½ inch of compost around the base every 3 weeks<br>
Experimental plant 4 with ½ inch of compost around the base every 4 weeks<br>
